I was assigned a task to clean vehicles data that was exported from a mysql database in a csv file.
To do:
1: I am required to remove all " quotes in the data ,
2:i am supposed to replace full colons that are separting datafields in lines with a comma (,)
3:I am supposed to generate a brand column from vehicles name column
4:I am required to drop some unnecessary columns from the dataset 
5: The final cleaned data should be saved in an excel file

In this task, i will be using python programming language together with some of its modules 
.ie, pandas will be the lybrary i'll be using for this task.
