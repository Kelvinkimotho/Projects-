## c language test 2
## answer the following questions.
1.There are N singers to particpate in a song contest, and there are 10 judges to score the singers. Count the highest
and lowest score for each judge.
2.Enter an Integer N, process it with a recursive algorithm and return its invers number. eg
   N=1234 , the return value is 4321
3.Randomly generate N integers beteween 1-100 ans store them in an array a[N] ;Sort them from smallest to largest
;Enter an integer X and find the number of elements in the array with half search method, if the number is not in the 
array, then print out "No such number!"  else "number found!"... 


## c language test 3
## answer the following questions

1: Enter N characters strings, sorted in order from large to small , and output.Requirements, use of pointers and functions to 
achieve input, output, sorting and other operations.
2: Western graphic characters can be divided into three categories: letters,numbers,other characters. Enter a character strings
,statistical letters, numbers, and other characters appear in this three categories of times. Requirements:The use of
pointers and function implementation.
3:There are 6 students, each student taking four courses, and the results data are as shown bellow
    {56,78,89,12},{26,58,59,82},{76,28,69,12},{66,78,99,45},{46,78,90,20},{34,78,76,12}

    i.check whether this students have failed courses.if so , output them and their full course grades
    ii.find the highest score for each course and print it.
    ..requirements are use of pointers and function implementation

i want us to implement test 3 and 3 separately. for test 2 , all the code should be implemented in one .c file, and
for test 3 , the same .. together with their header files.

## To compile the .c files to executables use the following commands
   --  gcc -std=c99 -o test3.exe test3.c
   --  gcc -std=c99 -o test2.exe test2.c
